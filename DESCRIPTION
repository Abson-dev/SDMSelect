Description: Select GAM, GLM models using a multiple k-fold cross-validation and 
  map species distribution while accounting for model uncertainties.
  Multiple family are possible and compared all together using RMSE or AUC as
  a result of cross-validation procedure. Covariates correlation may be tested.
  The model selection procedure will test different combinations of covariates
  with LM, GLM, GLM natural splines and GAM models, with different 
  distributions (Gaussian, Gamma, Log-Normal, Tweedie; Binomial) and
  with different maximum degrees of freedom for GLM with polynoms or
  natural splines. Calculations are parallelized when possible.
  Outputs are numerous, allowing for summary of the model selection and
  the comparison of the different models all together. The final model selected
  is used to map species distribution along with maps of uncertainty.
